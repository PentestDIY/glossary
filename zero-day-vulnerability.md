## Zero-Day Vulnerability

A zero-day vulnerability is a flaw in software, hardware, or firmware that is unknown to the vendor or the public. The term "zero-day" refers to the fact that the developer has had "zero days" to fix the vulnerability because they are unaware of its existence. Attackers who discover or purchase information about these vulnerabilities can exploit them to launch cyber-attacks before a patch or a security update is released. Because there is no existing defense, a zero-day exploit can be highly effective and dangerous.

### Examples

  * **Microsoft Exchange Server Vulnerabilities:** In early 2021, a series of zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange email servers were discovered and actively exploited by a threat actor. Attackers were able to gain access to email accounts and install malicious software, leading to widespread compromise of organizations before a patch was made available.
  * **Apple iOS Vulnerability:** Security researchers have uncovered zero-day vulnerabilities in Apple's iOS, which were used by spyware developers to remotely and secretly monitor iPhones without the user's knowledge. These exploits allowed the attackers to bypass Apple's security protections until the company released an emergency security update.

### How it Works

1.  **Discovery:** A threat actor discovers a previously unknown weakness in a piece of software. This could be a flaw in the code that allows for unauthorized access, remote code execution, or data theft.
2.  **Exploitation:** The attacker develops an exploitâ€”a piece of code or a technique that leverages the vulnerability to compromise a system. Since the vendor is unaware of the issue, there are no existing security measures, like an antivirus signature or a firewall rule, to detect or block the attack.
3.  **Attack:** The attacker uses the exploit to target systems. This could be done through a variety of methods, such as embedding the exploit in a malicious website, sending it via a phishing email, or using it to compromise a network.
4.  **Disclosure and Patch:** Eventually, the vulnerability is discovered by the vendor or a security researcher. The vendor then works to create a patch or an update to fix the flaw. The time between the discovery and the release of the patch is the critical "zero-day" window during which the vulnerability can be freely exploited.

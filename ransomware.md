## Ransomware

Ransomware is a type of malicious software (**malware**) that locks or encrypts a victim's files and data, making them inaccessible. The attacker then demands a payment (**a ransom**) from the victim to restore access. Ransomware attacks can cause significant financial loss and operational disruption for individuals and organizations. The attacker's goal is to compel the victim to pay the ransom, usually in untraceable cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

### Examples

  * **Crypto Ransomware:** This is the most common type. It uses strong encryption to scramble your files, documents, and pictures, rendering them unreadable. You can't access your data without a unique decryption key, which the attacker promises to provide after payment.
  * **Locker Ransomware:** This type of ransomware doesn't encrypt your files. Instead, it completely locks you out of your device or operating system, displaying a full-screen ransom note and preventing you from using your computer at all.
  * **Double Extortion:** A modern, more damaging tactic where attackers not only encrypt your data but also steal a copy of it first. If you refuse to pay for the decryption key, they threaten to publicly release your sensitive data or sell it to other criminals.
  * **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS):** This is a business model where less-skilled cybercriminals can "rent" ransomware from developers. The developers provide the tools and infrastructure for the attack, and the "affiliates" carry out the attack and split the ransom payment with the developers.

### How it Works

1.  **Infection:** The ransomware is delivered to a target system. This often happens through phishing emails with malicious attachments or links, malicious websites, or exploiting known software vulnerabilities.
2.  **Encryption/Lockout:** Once on the system, the ransomware runs and either encrypts the victim's files or locks them out of their device entirely. It often deletes or encrypts backup files to prevent easy recovery.
3.  **Ransom Demand:** A ransom note, typically a text file or an on-screen pop-up, appears. It explains what has happened and provides instructions on how to pay the ransom to receive the decryption key or unlock the system. The note often includes a deadline, after which the ransom may increase or the data may be permanently lost.

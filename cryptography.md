## Cryptography

Cryptography is the practice of securing information and communication by using codes so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it. In simple terms, it's the art of "secret writing" that protects data from unauthorized access. This is done by transforming readable information (**plaintext**) into an unreadable format (**ciphertext**). The process of converting plaintext to ciphertext is called **encryption**, and the reverse is called **decryption**. Cryptography is a cornerstone of modern cybersecurity, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data.

### Examples

  * **Secure Web Browsing (HTTPS):** When you visit a website with a URL that starts with "HTTPS," your browser and the website's server use cryptography to encrypt the data you send and receive, like passwords and credit card information. This prevents eavesdroppers from seeing your private data.
  * **Email Encryption:** Services like ProtonMail or software like Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) use cryptography to encrypt the content of your emails, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read them.
  * **Cryptocurrencies:** Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are built on cryptographic principles, specifically the use of complex algorithms to secure transactions, verify their integrity, and create new digital currency.

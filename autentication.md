## Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying a person's or entity's identity. It's the first step in granting access to a system, resource, or service. In the context of cybersecurity, it's how a system confirms that a user is who they claim to be, often before deciding what that user is allowed to do. Think of it as showing your ID to a security guard to prove you're the person on the card before they let you into a building.

### Examples

  * **Something you know:** Entering a password, a PIN, or answering a security question.
  * **Something you have:** Using a physical key card, a security token, or a one-time code sent to your phone.
  * **Something you are:** Using biometric data like a fingerprint, facial scan, or voice recognition.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a common and highly secure form of authentication that requires a user to provide two or more of these factors to prove their identity, such as a password (something you know) and a code from an app on your phone (something you have).

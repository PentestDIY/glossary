## Vulnerability 

In cybersecurity, a **vulnerability** is a weakness or flaw in a system, application, or process that an attacker can exploit to compromise its security. Think of it as a loose brick in a fortress wall; it doesn't cause a problem on its own, but an attacker can use it to get inside. Vulnerabilities aren't always immediately obvious and can exist in software code, system configurations, network design, or even human behavior. They are the "holes" that can lead to a breach, and identifying and fixing them is a core part of cybersecurity.

### Examples 

  * A classic example is an outdated software version with a known security bug. An attacker can use this bug to run malicious code on a server.
  * A weak password policy, such as allowing users to set "password123," is a vulnerability that an attacker can easily exploit through a brute-force attack.
  * A misconfigured firewall that leaves a port open to the public internet is a vulnerability that could allow unauthorized access.

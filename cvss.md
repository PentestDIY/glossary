## CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)

CVSS is a standardized system that provides a numerical score for the severity of a cybersecurity vulnerability. Think of it as a universal Richter scale for software flaws. When a new weakness is found in a piece of software, a CVSS score is calculated, ranging from 0.0 (low severity) to 10.0 (critical severity). This score gives your business a quick, easy-to-understand way to assess the potential danger of a vulnerability and helps your IT and security teams decide which problems to fix first.

### Business Impact

A CVSS score is a critical tool for business decision-making, even if you are not a technical expert. It helps you understand the **risk** a vulnerability poses to your company's assets and operations.

For example:

  * A vulnerability with a score of **9.5 (Critical)** in a web server that handles customer data means it is highly likely to be exploited and could lead to a severe data breach. This requires immediate, high-priority action from your team.
  * A vulnerability with a score of **3.0 (Low)** in a minor internal tool may not be a priority and can be addressed during a regular maintenance cycle.

The CVSS score helps your company avoid wasting time and resources on minor issues while ensuring that the most dangerous threats are addressed before they can cause significant financial loss, reputational damage, or operational disruption.

### How It Works

A CVSS score is made up of three parts, which together provide a comprehensive picture of the threat:

1.  **Base Score:** This is the most common score you will see. It reflects the inherent qualities of the vulnerability itself, such as how easy it is for an attacker to exploit and the potential damage they can cause to confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
2.  **Temporal Score:** This score changes over time. It factors in things like whether a fix has been released or if easy-to-use exploit tools have become publicly available.
3.  **Environmental Score:** This score is tailored to your specific business. Your security team can adjust the score based on how important the affected system is to your operations and what security controls you already have in place to reduce the risk.

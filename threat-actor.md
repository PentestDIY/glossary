## Threat Actor

A threat actor, also known as a malicious actor, is any individual or group that intentionally causes harm to digital systems, networks, or data. This term is broader than "hacker," as it describes the entity and their motivations rather than just the technical skills. A threat actor exploits vulnerabilities to carry out various cyber-attacks with the goal of causing disruption, stealing information, or causing financial loss. Understanding the different types of threat actors helps organizations prepare and defend against their specific methods and goals.

### Examples

Threat actors are often categorized by their motivations, which determine their tactics and level of sophistication:

  * **Cybercriminals:** These are individuals or groups primarily motivated by financial gain. They often use ransomware, phishing, or malware to steal data, hold systems hostage for a fee, or commit financial fraud. Their sophistication can range from single, opportunistic individuals to large, organized crime syndicates.
  * **Nation-State Actors:** These are sophisticated and highly resourced groups, often government-backed, that engage in cyber espionage or cyber warfare. Their goals are typically political, military, or economic, such as stealing state secrets, disrupting critical infrastructure, or influencing foreign elections.
  * **Hacktivists:** These actors are driven by a political or social cause. They use hacking to promote an agenda or make a statement, often by defacing websites, launching Denial-of-Service attacks, or leaking sensitive information to protest against an organization.
  * **Insiders:** These are individuals with legitimate access to an organization's systems, such as employees, contractors, or partners. An insider threat can be malicious (e.g., a disgruntled employee stealing data) or unintentional (e.g., an employee accidentally clicking a phishing link).
  * **Script Kiddies:** This term refers to inexperienced attackers who use pre-existing, freely available tools and scripts to launch attacks. While they may lack advanced technical skills, they can still cause significant disruption by exploiting known vulnerabilities, often for the thrill or to impress others.

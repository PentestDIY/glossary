## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a security method that requires a user to provide two or more different types of verification to gain access to an account or system. Rather than just a single password, it demands a combination of credentials from different categories. This layered approach significantly strengthens security because even if one factor is compromised (like a stolen password), an unauthorized person still cannot access the account without the other factors.

### Examples

MFA relies on at least two of the following three categories of verification factors:

  * **Something you know:** A password, PIN, or a security question.
  * **Something you have:** A physical object like a phone that receives a text message with a code, a physical security key (like a YubiKey), or a token from a mobile app like Google Authenticator.
  * **Something you are:** A unique physical characteristic like a fingerprint, a facial scan, or voice recognition.

A common example of MFA is when you log into an online bank account. After you enter your password (**something you know**), the bank sends a one-time code to your mobile phone (**something you have**), which you must also enter to complete the login. This is often referred to as **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**, which is a specific type of MFA requiring exactly two factors.

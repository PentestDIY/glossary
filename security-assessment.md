## Security Assessment

This is a comprehensive check-up of an organization's systems, processes, and people to find vulnerabilities and risks. Think of it as a doctor performing a full physical exam, using various tests and tools to find any signs of illness or risk. A security assessment is a crucial first step that happens **before** a penetration test and does not include active exploitation.

## Security Assessment vs. Penetration Testing

A **security assessment** is the initial, broad process of evaluating your security posture to identify potential weaknesses. It’s like getting a full health check-up. It uses many automated scanners to obtain data about your environment. It's like having your blood taken and sent to a lab for analysis. 
These results may indicate false positives and potentially require an expert to review and do further analysis - much like a doctor reviewing your blood test results before making a diagnosis.  

A **penetration test** (pentest), on the other hand, is a targeted, hands-on simulation of a real-world cyber attack. It’s what happens *after* the initial check-up. The pentester, or ethical hacker, tries to exploit the vulnerabilities found during the assessment to see if they can gain unauthorized access. This is a much deeper dive that actively tests the effectiveness of your security controls.

### What are False Positives?

A **false positive** occurs when a security tool flags something as a threat when it's actually harmless or not the root cause of the issue. Imagine a smoke alarm going off because you’re cooking toast—that's a false positive. The event did not pose any meaningful risk to the organization.

### False Positives and Security Assessments

Security Assessments are known to produce false positives, especially during the initial discovery phase when automated scanning tools are used. These tools are great for quickly finding a large number of potential vulnerabilities, but they can't tell you if a weakness is truly exploitable. A skilled pentester manually validates these results, providing a report with a much higher degree of accuracy and a clear focus on the most critical, exploitable risks. This makes a penetration test report far more valuable than a raw scan report.

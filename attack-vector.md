## Attack Vector

An attack vector is the specific method or path a cybercriminal uses to gain unauthorized access to a system, network, or data. It is the "how" of an attack. While a vulnerability is the weakness itself (e.g., a door left unlocked), an attack vector is the way a criminal exploits that weakness to get in (e.g., walking through the unlocked door). Understanding and identifying attack vectors is a core part of cybersecurity because it allows a business to focus on closing the most likely entry points that a threat actor would use.

### Examples

  * **Phishing:** A very common attack vector where a threat actor sends a fraudulent email to trick an employee into revealing their password or clicking a link that installs malware.
  * **Unpatched Software:** A threat actor can exploit a known vulnerability in a program that has not been updated with the latest security patches. This is a common method for deploying ransomware.
  * **Stolen Credentials:** An attacker might buy a list of stolen usernames and passwords on the dark web and use them to gain access to a company's systems, especially if employees reuse passwords across different services.
  * **Malicious Insider:** A disgruntled employee or contractor with legitimate access can intentionally misuse their privileges to steal data or disrupt operations.
  * **Poor Security Configuration:** An attacker can exploit a system that has been misconfigured, such as a cloud storage bucket left open to the public or a firewall with incorrect settings.

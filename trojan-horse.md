## Trojan Horse

A Trojan Horse, or simply a Trojan, is a type of malicious software (**malware**) that tricks users into installing it by disguising itself as a legitimate or useful program. Unlike a virus, it cannot replicate itself. It relies on deception and social engineering to get a user to download and run it. The name comes from the ancient Greek story of the Trojan War, where Greek soldiers hid inside a large wooden horse to infiltrate the city of Troy. In cybersecurity, the Trojan acts as the deceptive carrier, hiding its true, malicious purpose until it is inside the system and activated by the user.

### Examples

  * **Malicious Email Attachments:** An attacker sends an email that appears to be a legitimate file, such as a PDF invoice, a resume, or a software update. When the user opens the attachment, the Trojan is installed on their computer without their knowledge.
  * **Fake Software or Updates:** A user downloads a program from an unofficial website, such as a pirated video game or a "free" utility tool. The program seems to function normally, but it secretly contains a Trojan that can steal information or create a "backdoor" for the attacker.
  * **Banking Trojans:** This specific type of Trojan is designed to steal financial information. It might trick a user into downloading a fake app that mimics a legitimate banking application, then records their login credentials and sends them to the attacker.
  * **Ransomware Droppers:** A Trojan can act as a "dropper," which is a piece of code that, once executed, downloads and installs other, more destructive malware, such as ransomware, onto the victim's system.

### How it Works

1.  **Deception:** The Trojan is packaged to look like something innocent or desirable (e.g., a game, a free movie, a helpful tool).
2.  **User Interaction:** The victim must be tricked into downloading and executing the program. This can happen through social engineering tactics like phishing or by visiting a compromised website.
3.  **Infiltration:** Once the program is run, the Trojan's malicious payload is released and can perform various harmful actions, such as:
      * Stealing sensitive data (passwords, banking information).
      * Monitoring user activity (keylogging).
      * Deleting, blocking, or modifying files.
      * Providing the attacker with remote access to the computer (**backdoor**).
      * Turning the computer into a part of a **botnet** to launch other attacks.

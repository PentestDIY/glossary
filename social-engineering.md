## Social Engineering

Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging confidential information. Unlike traditional hacking that exploits software vulnerabilities, social engineering exploits human nature and trust. It's a non-technical attack that plays on a victim's emotions—such as fear, urgency, or curiosity—to trick them into making security mistakes. An attacker might impersonate a trustworthy person, a colleague, or a figure of authority to gain the confidence of their target. The goal is to bypass technical security measures by getting the person to unknowingly grant access or provide the information themselves.

### Examples

  * **Phishing:** The most common form of social engineering. An attacker sends a fraudulent email, text message, or other communication that appears to be from a legitimate source (like a bank, a well-known company, or a government agency) to trick a person into revealing personal information or clicking a malicious link.
  * **Pretexting:** Creating a fabricated scenario (a "pretext") to engage a victim and manipulate them into divulging information. For example, an attacker might call an employee pretending to be from the IT department, claiming they need the employee's login credentials to "fix a critical server issue."
  * **Baiting:** An attacker uses a false promise to lure a victim into a trap. This can be online (e.g., "Free movie downloads\!") or physical (e.g., leaving a USB drive labeled "Confidential Employee Bonuses" in a public place, hoping someone will plug it into their computer).
  * **Quid Pro Quo:** An attacker offers a "service" in exchange for information. For example, an attacker pretending to be a tech support professional offers to solve a problem for a victim in exchange for their password.
  * **Tailgating (or Piggybacking):** A physical form of social engineering where an unauthorized person follows an employee into a restricted area, often by simply asking the employee to hold the door open for them.

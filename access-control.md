## Access Control

Access control is a security process that regulates who or what can view or use resources within a system or organization. It's essentially the gatekeeper for information and assets, ensuring that only authorized individuals or entities can get to what they need. This is a fundamental concept in security, as it protects sensitive data and critical systems from being accessed, changed, or destroyed by unauthorized parties. The core idea is to apply a "principle of least privilege," meaning a person or system should only have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their required tasks.

### Examples

  * **Physical Access Control:** Using a key card to enter a secure data center.
  * **Logical Access Control:** A user needing to enter a password to log in to their email account.
  * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** A human resources manager having access to employee records, while a sales team member only has access to customer information.
  * **Discretionary Access Control (DAC):** A file owner being able to set permissions on their personal files, allowing a specific colleague to edit it.

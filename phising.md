## Phishing

Phishing is a type of cyber-attack where a scammer, disguised as a trustworthy person or organization, attempts to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information. This can be done through emails, text messages, instant messages, or even phone calls. The goal is to deceive the victim into taking an action, such as clicking a malicious link, downloading a harmful attachment, or providing personal data like passwords, credit card numbers, or bank account information. The success of phishing relies on social engineeringâ€”manipulating a victim's trust and emotions, often creating a false sense of urgency or fear.

### Examples

  * **Email Phishing:** An email that appears to be from your bank warns you of "suspicious activity" on your account and asks you to click a link to "verify your identity" immediately. The link, however, leads to a fake website that looks identical to your bank's, where any credentials you enter are stolen by the attacker.
  * **Spear Phishing:** A more targeted attack, where the scammer researches a specific individual. For example, a senior executive might receive an email that looks like it's from the CEO, asking them to urgently transfer funds or share a confidential document.
  * **Smishing and Vishing:** "Smishing" is phishing via SMS text messages. "Vishing" is a phishing attack conducted over the phone, where the attacker impersonates a company representative (e.g., tech support) to trick you into revealing information.
  * **Whaling:** A highly targeted form of spear phishing that specifically goes after high-profile individuals, such as CEOs or CFOs, with the goal of gaining access to valuable company assets or information.

### How to Recognize a Phishing Attempt

  * **Sense of Urgency:** The message pressures you to act immediately to avoid a negative consequence (e.g., "Your account will be suspended\!").
  * **Suspicious Sender:** The email address is slightly misspelled (e.g., `micr0s0ft.com` instead of `microsoft.com`) or comes from a public domain like `@gmail.com`.
  * **Generic Greetings:** The message uses a generic greeting like "Dear Customer" instead of your actual name.
  * **Poor Grammar and Spelling:** While becoming less common due to AI tools, many phishing attempts still contain obvious grammatical errors or typos.
  * **Unexpected Attachments or Links:** You receive an unexpected attachment or a link that, when you hover your mouse over it, shows a different URL than the one in the text.

## Brute-Force Attack

A brute-force attack is a trial-and-error method used by attackers to guess information such as passwords, user credentials, or encryption keys. Attackers use automated tools to systematically try every possible combination of characters until they find the correct one. The name "brute-force" comes from the forceful, repetitive nature of these attacks, which rely on sheer computing power rather than sophisticated logic.

It's similar to a burglar trying every single key on a massive keychain in a lock until they find the one that fits.  While it may seem inefficient, these attacks are very effective against weak or simple passwords. The time it takes for a brute-force attack to succeed is directly related to the length and complexity of the targetâ€”the longer and more random the password, the exponentially longer the attack will take.

### Examples

  * **Simple Brute-Force:** An attacker uses a program to try every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols to guess a password for a single user account.
  * **Dictionary Attack:** A specialized form of brute-force attack where the attacker uses a pre-compiled list of common words and phrases (like a dictionary) as a starting point, often with variations like adding numbers or special characters.
  * **Credential Stuffing:** This is a type of brute-force attack that uses a list of stolen username and password pairs from a data breach and then tries those same pairs on other websites. It exploits the common practice of users reusing the same passwords across multiple accounts.
  * **Password Spraying:** Instead of trying many passwords for one user, an attacker tries one common password (like "password123") against a large number of usernames to avoid triggering account lockout policies.

## OWASP and the OWASP Top 10

OWASP, which stands for the **Open Worldwide Application Security Project**, is a global, non-profit organization dedicated to improving software security. It's a community-driven group of volunteers, including developers, security experts, and businesses, who share knowledge and create free tools and resources to help everyone build more secure software. Think of OWASP as a collective brain trust for application securityâ€”they don't sell products; they provide expert guidance to make the internet a safer place.

### The OWASP Top 10

The most famous resource from OWASP is the **OWASP Top 10**. This is a document that is updated every few years and lists the ten most critical security risks facing web applications. It's an awareness document, not a standard, but it has become an industry benchmark that many businesses use to prioritize their security efforts. The list is based on data from security professionals and organizations around the world, giving it credibility and real-world relevance.

For a business user, the OWASP Top 10 is your team's checklist for what matters most. It's a high-level guide to help you understand and discuss the biggest application security risks with your technical teams, auditors, and management.

Here are some of the common risks you'll find on the list:

  * **Injection:** This is when an attacker sends malicious data to an application to make it do something it's not supposed to, like stealing information from a database.
  * **Broken Access Control:** This means the application's security is weak and allows an attacker to get into areas they shouldn't, like viewing another customer's private data or accessing administrative features.
  * **Security Misconfiguration:** This is a very common problem where security settings are not properly set up, such as leaving default passwords in place or exposing unnecessary services to the internet.

By focusing on these top ten risks, your company can build more secure products and significantly reduce the likelihood of a major cyber-attack. It provides a common language and a clear roadmap for security improvements that everyone in the business can understand.
